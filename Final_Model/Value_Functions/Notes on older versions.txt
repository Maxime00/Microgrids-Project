sarsa v13
2 episodes of 30 minutes, 2s action frequency
also changed reward
also changed so reward is mean reward over idle_iter
noticed tile coding only tiled DISTINCT ints differently, so added conversion to action list so its tiled properly

sarsav15
20 episodes of 3 minutes, 2s action frequency
tuned reward, it should not be positive if SoC is outside the range

sarsa v 17
20 episodes of 3 minutes, 2s action frequency
tuned reward again
ran it 2 hours

qfit v2.2 -> overwritten by accident, rerun maybe?
15 episodes with 1000 training samples
wait 0,2 seconds after init for settling, then select best action, ten wait another 0,2 sec to evaluate action

NOTE : second delay should be longer, probably around 2 seconds -> NOPE, makes it worse (only one battery stays within range, other goes to 0)

qfit v2.3
15 episodes with 100 training samples
wait 0,2 seconds after init for settling, then select best action, ten wait 2secs to evaluate action ->doesn’t work, not enough samples 

NAF v3 (cdqn_Microgrids_weights_v3)
proces action to have positive values = 1 and negative = 0 (transform for environment)
training : 15000 steps,  action frequency 100 ms
test : works with action frequency 10 ms, 

NAF v4
ran for 1h instead of 25 minutes -> worst results 

sarsa v18
ran 2h with updated tile coding approx (more maxsize and tiling), should be more precise 
also noticed actually have been using action instead of tile_cation in vf -> why does it work

sarsav19
ran 2h again, just changed the action so vf is now actually vf and not qf (uses action and nto tile action)
kept 8 tilings and 32’000 maxsize

sarsav20
20 episodes of 3 minutes 2s action freq , 4 tilings now, kept tile action

sarsav21
retrained v20 for an hour
training - always converges to 60 in SoC

qfit v2.4 
15 episodes with 1000 training samples
wait 0,2 seconds after init for settling, then select best action, ten wait another 0,2 sec to evaluate action
used tileaction in vf 

qfit v2.5
retrained v2.4 for an hour
